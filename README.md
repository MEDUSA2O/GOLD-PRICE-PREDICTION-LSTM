# GOLD-PRICE-PREDICTION-LSTM
This project focuses on predicting gold prices using historical data and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. LSTM networks are well-suited for time series forecasting due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.
# Gold Price Prediction using LSTM

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting gold prices using historical data and LSTM neural networks.

## Dependencies
- Python 
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
1. Preprocess the data using `data_preprocessing.py`.
2. Train the LSTM model using `train_model.py`.
3. Make predictions using `predict.py`.

## Data
The historical gold price data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

## Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of multiple LSTM layers with dropout for regularization.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and accuracy metrics.
